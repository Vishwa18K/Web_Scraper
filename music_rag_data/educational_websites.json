But over time, something deeper begins to take shape…\n\nYou start to realize that soloing isn’t just about hitting the right notes or outlining the changes – it’s about \nmotion\n. The sense that your solo is going somewhere…telling a \nstory\n.…\nmoving\n forward through the form.\n\nIt comes down to the simple and timeless concept of \ntension and release\n. And this is something the best players don’t leave up to chance, they have specific techniques to create musical momentum.\n\nAs an improviser, the more tactics you have for creating this kind of motion, the more powerful your solos will become. \n\nIn this lesson for \nPremium members\n we’re going to explore how to shape not only the larger arc of your solos, but the specific movement through the established form of a tune.\n\nInside you’ll learn:\n\n7 essential dominant resolutions\n for creating forward motion \n\nThe key \ntransition points\n in the blues\n\nSpecific lines\n utilizing these concepts\n\nAnd how \nHerbie Hancock\n & \nMcCoy Tyner\n \nmanipulate tension and ...\n\nHey, Sorry to Interrupt...\n\nI know you were really enjoying this lesson and super excited to learn something new, but we",

Si Si\n\nParker’s tune \nSi Si\n, an F blues, was recorded during the same 1951 session that produced \nBlues for Alice\n and featured players like Red Rodney, John Lewis, Ray Brown, and Kenny Clarke.\n\nThe melody to \nSi Si\n contains many elements of a bebop blues, however the second bar presents a curve ball, with an E natural, C#, and A natural in the melody – creating dissonance before returning to diatonic material in the 3rd bar.",

    "content": "Bill Evans: 4 Tools for Creating Harmonic Motion\n\n By \n\nEric\n\nChords\n, \nJazz Musicians\n, \nJazz Standards\n, \nPremium\n\nBill Evans\n\nFor any improviser learning jazz standards, one of the greatest challenges isn’t just learning the chords to a tune – it’s \nmaking music\n with them when you take a solo.\n\nAnd this can be tricky, because the harmony on the page is just a starting point. The real magic begins when you start to move \nbeyond\n what’s written. \n\nYou see, great improvisers don’t simply follow the chords – they reshape them, weaving in color, motion, and tension. This is the difference between static harmony and what we might call \nliving harmony\n: a fluid, expressive approach that turns even the most familiar progression into something personal.\n\nAnd few musicians embodied this better than \nBill Evans\n…\n\nIn this \nPremium lesson\n, we’ll explore how Evans approached harmony with remarkable freedom and clarity. \n\nAnd through the lens of a classic jazz standard, we’ll break down \n4 powerful harmonic tools\n he used to navigate—and elevate—any progression, tools that will open up doors in your own playing.\n\nLet’s dive in…\n\nMusic Theory vs. The Practice of Harmony\n\nAs you’ve probably realized by now, there’s a difference between memorizing the chords to a jazz standard ...\n\nHey, Sorry to Interrupt...\n\nI know you were really enjoying this lesson and super excited to learn",

And that these holes cause most of the problems that are holding you back from playing jazz tunes the way you want to?\n\nJazz theory today is based on \n“modal”\n thinking – A bunch of scales that you quickly memorize and apply to each chord using various rules…\n\nAnd this method is fine for getting your foot in the door, but fails as you try to move up to the next level because it skips over some of the key components of what’s \nactually\n going on in the music.\n\nNow I learned this the hard way…\n\nI went years memorizing chords to tunes and applying scales to them without a complete understanding of what was really going on in the changes. I was in the dark, and deep down I knew it. I had a million questions as to why certain things were the way they were in jazz, and I couldn’t find the answers anywhere.\n\nAfter years of struggling, I figured out that the thing I lacked then is exactly what so many others are lacking today: \nA Strong Understanding of Harmony\n.\n\nAnd the great news is, you don’t have to waste years to acquire this skill and figure everything out on your own like I did. In this course, we’ve paved your way to understanding harmony and theory once and for all.",

And sadly, this skill has been lost in the modern approach to jazz theory.\n\nIn this course you’ll rediscover this lost skill of the masters.\n\nUsing the fundamental principles inside, you’ll learn to see harmony and chord progressions in a new light. No more guessing why a chord is there in the progression, and no more fumbling through the chord changes trying to connect two seemingly unrelated chords…\n\nEverything is related and connected, but no one ever bothered to teach you how. And this is what’s holding you back…\n\nYour ability to play a jazz solo the way you want to, compose easily, and improvise creatively is directly related to how you understand harmony – this is why you need this course, because to really play a tune, you have to understand functional harmony on a deep level, where everything comes from, and how everything is related.\n\nLet’s",

    "content": "to this point in your jazz improvisation journey, it’s probably been a mystery as to what’s harmonically possible at a any given time. This leads to a world of confusion and misunderstanding. But with the multiple frameworks we give you on Major and Minor Harmony, and how to get beyond them, you’ll have a clear view of harmonic possibility once and for all.\n\nIf you’re operating with only pieces of information or an incomplete view, it’s time to remedy that by learning the whole system that we share with you in this course.\n\nWhat makes Jazz Theory Unlocked different?\n\nThis course certainly is different.\n\nInstead of giving you a bunch of scale choices and showing you how to apply them to chords like most jazz theory today is all about, this course gives you a strong foundation in harmony…\n\nIn 5 parts, with over 60 videos, you’ll learn…\n\nWhere chords actually come from and how they behave\n\nHow to build Major Harmony from the ground up, every detail\n\nHow to build Minor Harmony and all the issues that trip everyone up\n\nHow Major & Minor harmony interact and connect\n\nHow jazz musicians can expand their harmonic universe\n\nThe deeper side of dominant chords and alterations\n\nThe true role of diminished chords and how to approach them\n\nHow chords move and all the reasons behind why\n\nHow tunes are put together and what makes them stand out\n\nHow composers use a particular way of thinking to achieve the unexpected\n\nBy using a unique way to teach you the complex concepts of music theory and",

    "content": "harmony, \nJazz Theory Unlocked\n explores all this and a whole lot more…\n\nRather than making you study a dense theory book and boring you with loads of scales or rules that don’t ultimately help you, we’ve constructed fun and engaging video lectures that break down everything you need to know in a clear and concise way.\n\nHere’s what makes the course & teaching style so special…\n\nIt’s Super Visual\n – Most jazz theory books, classes, or programs are built around standard music notation and classical musical excerpts. This isn’t. In this course we present the information in a highly visual way including tons of diagrams and drawings that will aid in your ability to mentally conceptualize harmony. This is a game changer for jazz musicians who need everything functioning clearly in their mind.\n\nIt’s Fun & Engaging\n – Forget the dull and dry theory you’re used to…this course teaches you in a fun and casual manner, something everyone can relate to. Through this entertaining style, you’ll easily retain the information and understand it on a deep level. You won’t be falling asleep or struggling with technical jargon.\n\nIt Guides You Through Every Detail\n – More often than not, jazz theory today skips important steps while attempting to teach vital concepts, glossing over the many details that matter. Instead, we guide you the entire way, making sure that these important details don’t slip through the cracks because when it comes to jazz, a lot of your understanding comes directly from these subtle details.\n\nIt’s",

In the videos, we’ve shared with you our \naha\n moments, giving you the insights you need to break through.\n\nIt Highlights the Differences With Jazz\n – Most music theory today is a hodgepodge of classical music theory, modal thinking, and scale application, but none of these actually get to the heart of the matter. Jazz is different than any other music and it’s time that a theory course take that into account. We do, which allows us to shed light on problems that have been completely ignored by modern jazz education. When you treat jazz as the unique music it is, the theory becomes a lot more clear.\n\nAll you have to do is watch and learn as we illustrate key components of jazz theory that have never been given the necessary attention. Simply go at your pace, pause the videos on key diagrams and review the information as much as you like.\n\nAnd when you’re ready, you can work on the lesson assignments to strengthen everything you’ve learned and put it into practice. With this course you’ll gain a deeper understanding of jazz theory and harmony than ever before…\n\nEvery great jazz musician has a deep understanding of harmony.

Music is a very large subject, and the advanced theory that students will want to pursue after mastering the basics will vary greatly. A trumpet player interested in jazz, a vocalist interested in early music, a pianist interested in classical composition, and a guitarist interested in world music, will all want to delve into very different facets of music theory; although, interestingly, if they all become very well-versed in their chosen fields, they will still end up very capable of understanding each other and cooperating in musical endeavors. The final section of this course does include a few challenges that are generally not considered \"beginner level\" musicianship, but are very useful in just about every field and genre of music.\n\nThe main purpose of the course, however, is to explore basic music theory so thoroughly that the interested student will then be able to easily pick up whatever further theory is wanted. Music history and the physics of sound are included to the extent that they shed light on music",

Students who find the section on acoustics (The Physical Basis) uninteresting may skip it at first, but should then go back to it when they begin to want to understand why musical sounds work the way they do. Remember, the main premise of this course is that a better understanding of where the basics come from will lead to better and faster comprehension of more complex ideas.\n\nIt also helps to remember, however, that music theory is a bit like grammar. Languages are invented by the people who speak them, who tend to care more about what is easy and what makes sense than about following rules. Later, experts study the best speakers and writers in order to discover how they use language. These language theorists then make up rules that clarify grammar and spelling and point out the relationships between words. Those rules are only guidelines based on patterns discovered by the theoreticians, which is why there are usually plenty of \"exceptions\" to every rule. Attempts to develop a new language by first inventing the grammar and spelling never seem to result in a language that people find useful.\n\nMusic theory, too, always comes along after a group of composers and performers have already developed a musical tradition. Theoreticians then study the resulting music and discover good ways of explaining it to the audience and to other composers and performers. So sometimes the answer to \"Why is it that way?\" is simply \"that's what is easiest for the performer\", or \"they borrowed that from an earlier music tradition\".\n\nIn the",

Adults who have already had some music instruction should be able to work through this course with or without a teacher; simply use the opening sections to review any concepts that are unclear or half-forgotten. Young students and beginning musicians should go through it with a teacher, in either a classroom or lesson setting.\n\nThere is, even within the English-speaking world, quite a variety of music teaching traditions, which sometimes use different terms for the same concepts.

Every time you want to send an assignment to your students, you can create a smaller workbook and import lessons or modules from that 'master workbook' using the \nTools-->Import lessons from workbook\n option in the \nWorkbook Editor\n.\n\nThat way, when the year has passed, you will have a all the assignments from the passed year nicely gathered into a single workbook, ready to be reused next year.\n\n Sign up for the EarMaster Educational Newsletter\n\r\nSign up for our educational newsletter to be updated about new releases, new features, tips to use EarMaster in educational settings, promotional offers, webinars, and more.",

The musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis \"in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.\"\n[\n1\n]\n\nMusic theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including \ntuning systems\n and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of \nwhat constitutes music\n, a more inclusive definition could be the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence.

For example, ancient instruments from \nprehistoric\n sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers. In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music-making. Many cultures have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written \ntreatises\n and \nmusic notation\n. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as \nscholarly writing\n cites earlier research.\n\nIn modern academia, music theory is a subfield of \nmusicology\n, the wider study of musical cultures and history. \nGuido Adler\n, however, in one of the texts",

The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation rather than an objective measurement of sound.\n[\n28\n]\n\nSpecific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign \nconcert A\n (the A above \nmiddle C\n on the piano) to the frequency of 440 Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435 Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in \nhistorically informed performance\n of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.\n\nThe difference in pitch between two notes is called an \ninterval\n.

    "content": "-octave harmonics\n\nIn the modern era, musical \nset theory\n uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as \ntransposition\n and \ninversion\n, one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called \nisometries\n because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an \nabelian group\n with 12 elements. It is possible to describe \njust intonation\n in terms of a \nfree abelian group\n.\n[\n92\n]\n\nSerial composition and set theory\n[\nedit\n]\n\nTone row from \nAlban Berg\n's \nLyric Suite\n, movement I\n\nFurther information: \nSerialism\n, \nSet theory (music)\n, \nArnold Schoenberg\n, \nMilton Babbitt\n, \nDavid Lewin\n, and \nAllen Forte\n\nIn music theory, serialism is a method or technique of \ncomposition\n that uses a series of values to manipulate different \nmusical elements\n.

It is the most common form of notation used by professional \nsession musicians\n playing \njazz\n or \npopular music\n. It is intended primarily for a \nrhythm section\n (usually consisting of \npiano\n, \nguitar\n, \ndrums\n and \nbass\n). In these genres the musicians are expected to be able to \nimprovise\n the individual notes used for the \nchords\n (the \"\nvoicing\n\") and the appropriate \nornamentation\n, \ncounter melody\n or \nbassline\n.\n\nIn some chord charts, the harmony is given as a series of \nchord symbols\n above a traditional \nmusical staff\n. The rhythmic information can be very specific and written using a form of traditional notation, sometimes called \nrhythmic notation\n, or it can be completely unspecified using \nslash notation\n, allowing the musician to fill the bar with chords or fills any way they see fit (called \ncomping\n). In \nNashville notation\n the \nkey\n is left unspecified on the chart by substituting numbers for chord names. This facilitates on-the-spot key changes to songs. Chord charts may also include",

The tonic of a scale is the note selected as the beginning of the octave, and therefore as the beginning of the adopted interval pattern.

Such labeling requires the choice of a \"first\" note; hence scale-degree labels are not intrinsic to the scale itself, but rather to its modes. For example, if we choose A as tonic, then we can label the notes of the C major scale using A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, and so on. When we do so, we create a new scale called the A",

    "content": "minor scale\n. See the \nmusical note\n article for how the notes are customarily named in different countries.\n\nThe scale degrees of a heptatonic (7-note) scale can also be named using the terms \ntonic\n, \nsupertonic\n, \nmediant\n, \nsubdominant\n, \ndominant\n, \nsubmediant\n, \nsubtonic\n. If the subtonic is a semitone away from the tonic, then it is usually called the \nleading-tone\n (or leading-note); otherwise the leading-tone refers to the raised subtonic. Also commonly used is the (movable do) \nsolfège\n naming convention in which each scale degree is denoted by a syllable. In the major scale, the solfège syllables are: do, re, mi, fa, so (or sol), la, ti (or si), do (or ut).\n\nIn naming the notes of a scale, it is customary that each scale degree be assigned its own letter name: for example, the A major scale is written A–B–C\n♯\n–D–E–F\n♯\n–G\n♯\n rather than A–B–D\n♭\n–D–E–E\n–G\n♯\n. However, it is impossible to do this in scales that contain more than seven notes, at least in the English-language nomenclature",

    "content": "system.\n[\n10\n]\n\nScales may also be identified by using a binary system of twelve zeros or ones to represent each of the twelve notes of a \nchromatic scale\n. The most common binary numbering scheme defines lower pitches to have lower numeric value (as opposed to low pitches having a high numeric value). Thus a single pitch class n in the pitch class set is represented by 2^n. This maps the entire power set of all pitch class sets in 12-TET to the numbers 0 to 4095. The binary digits read as ascending pitches from right to left, which some find discombobulating because they are used to low to high reading left to right, as on a piano keyboard. In this scheme, the major scale is 101010110101 = 2741. This binary representation permits easy calculation of interval vectors and common tones, using logical binary operators. It also provides a perfect index for every possible combination of tones, as every scale has its own number.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n\nScales may also be shown as \nsemitones\n from the tonic. For instance, 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 denotes any major scale such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B, in which the first degree is, obviously, 0 semitones from the tonic (and therefore coincides with it), the second is 2 semitones from the tonic,",

    "content": "the third is 4 semitones from the tonic, and so on. Again, this implies that the notes are drawn from a chromatic scale tuned with 12-tone equal temperament. For some fretted string instruments, such as the guitar and the \nbass guitar\n, scales can be notated in \ntabulature\n, an approach which indicates the fret number and string upon which each scale degree is played.\n\nTransposition and modulation\n[\nedit\n]\n\nComposers transform musical patterns by moving every note in the pattern by a constant number of scale steps: thus, in the \nC major\n scale, the pattern C–D–E might be shifted up, or \ntransposed\n, a single scale step to become D–E–F. This process is called \"scalar transposition\" or \"shifting to a new key\" and can often be found in \nmusical sequences\n and patterns. (It is D–E–F\n♯\n in Chromatic transposition). Since the steps of a scale can have various sizes, this process introduces subtle melodic and harmonic variation into the music. In Western tonal music, the simplest and most common type of modulation (or changing keys) is to shift from one major key to another key built on the first key's fifth (or dominant) scale degree. In the key of C major, this would involve moving to the key of G major (which uses an F\n♯\n).",

Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed, Five refers to the Pentatonic Scale (primarily uses a 5-note scale), And Eight refers to the eight categories of Chinese Music Instruments; classified by the material they are made from: (Metal, Stone, Silk, Bamboo, Gourd, Clay, Leather, and Wood). The [[Lüshi chunqiu]] from about 238&nbsp;BCE recalls the legend of [[Ling Lun]]. On order of the [[Yellow Emperor]], Ling Lun collected twelve [[bamboo]] lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it ''huangzhong'', the \"Yellow Bell.\" He then heard [[Fenghuang|phoenixes]]",

The ''[[Record of Music|Yueji]]'' (\"Record of music\", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests [[Confucianism|Confucian]] moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of [[Mozi]] (c. 468 – c. 376&nbsp;BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and [[Laozi]]'s claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the [[Guqin|''qin'' zither]], a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with [[Taoism|Daoist]] references, such as ''Tianfeng huanpei'' (\"Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade P",

Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed, Five refers to the Pentatonic Scale (primarily uses a 5-note scale), And Eight refers to the eight categories of Chinese Music Instruments; classified by the material they are made from: (Metal, Stone, Silk, Bamboo, Gourd, Clay, Leather, and Wood). The [[Lüshi chunqiu]] from about 238&nbsp;BCE recalls the legend of [[Ling Lun]]. On order of the [[Yellow Emperor]], Ling Lun collected twelve [[bamboo]] lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it ''huang",

The ''[[Record of Music|Yueji]]'' (\"Record of music\", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests [[Confucianism|Confucian]] moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of [[Mozi]] (c. 468 – c. 376&nbsp;BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and [[Laozi]]'s claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the [[Guqin|''qin'' zither]], a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with [[Taoism|Daoist]] references, such",

Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}} This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the [[plainchant]] tradition.<ref>{{harvnb|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists §5 Early Middle Ages}}: \"Boethius could provide",

    "content": "Ages}}\n\nDuring the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called [[mensural notation]] grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' (\"The art of measured chant\") by [[Franco of Cologne]] (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in [[European classical music]] today.\n\nEdit summary\n \n(Briefly describe your changes)\n\nBy publishing changes, you agree to the \nTerms of Use\n, and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the \nCC BY-SA 4.0 License\n and the \nGFDL\n.

    "content": ". Aristotle had believed that in order for the eye to perceive an object, both the eye and the object must be in contact with a transparent medium (such as air) that is filled with light. When these criteria are met, the \"sensible form\" of the object is transmitted through the medium to the eye. On the other hand, Euclid proposed that vision occurred in straight lines when \"rays\" from the eye reached an illuminated object and were reflected back. As with his theories on Astrology, the dichotomy of contact and distance is present in al-Kindi's writings on this subject as well.\n\nThe factor which al-Kindi relied upon to determine which of these theories was most correct was how adequately each one explained the experience of seeing. For example, Aristotle's theory was unable to account for why the angle at which an individual sees an object affects his perception of it. For example, why a circle viewed from the side will appear as a line. According to Aristotle, the \ncomplete\n sensible form of a circle should be transmitted to the eye and it should appear as a circle. On the other hand, Euclidean optics provided a geometric model that was able to account for this, as well as the length of shadows and reflections in mirrors, because Euclid believed that the visual \"rays\" could only travel in straight lines. For this reason, al-Kindi considered the latter preponderant.\n[\n36\n]\n\nAl-Kindi's primary optical treatise",

By this he means that while we may think of any existent thing as being \"one\", it is in fact both \"one\" and many\". For example, he says that while a body is one, it is also composed of many different parts. A person might say \"I see an elephant\", by which he means \"I see \none\n elephant\", but the term 'elephant' refers to a species of animal that contains many. Therefore, only God is absolutely one, both in being and in concept, lacking any multiplicity whatsoever.

It was the first of God's creation and the intermediary through which all other things came into creation. Aside from its obvious metaphysical importance, it was also crucial to al-Kindi's \nepistemology\n, which was influenced by \nPlatonic realism\n.\n[\n57\n]\n\nAccording to Plato, everything that exists in the material world corresponds to certain \nuniversal forms\n in the heavenly realm. These forms are really abstract concepts such as a species, quality or relation, which apply to all physical objects and beings. For example, a red apple has the quality of \"redness\" derived from the appropriate universal. However, al-Kindi says that human intellects are only \npotentially",

He argues that the external agency of this intellect is necessary by saying that human beings cannot arrive at a universal concept merely through perception. In other words, an intellect cannot understand the species of a thing simply by examining one or more of its instances. According to him, this will only yield an inferior \"sensible form\", and not the universal form which we desire. The universal form can only be attained through contemplation and actualization by the First Intellect.\n[\n58\n]\n\nThe analogy he provides to explain his theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human is potentially thinking about a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already be thinking about it. Therefore, he says that the First Intellect must always be thinking about everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's \"acquired intellect\" and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.\n[\n59\n]\n\nThe soul and the afterlife\n[\nedit\n]\n\nAl-Kindi says that the soul is a simple, immaterial substance, which is related to the material world only because of its faculties which operate through the",

The implicit warning is that those passengers who linger too long on the island may be left behind when the ship sets sail again. Here, al-Kindi displays a \nstoic\n concept, that we must not become attached to material things (represented by the island), as they will invariably be taken away from us (when the ship sets sail again). He then connects this with a Neo-Platonist idea, by saying that our soul can be directed towards the pursuit of desire or the pursuit of intellect; the former will tie it to the body, so that when the body dies, it will also die, but the latter will free it from the body and allow it to survive \"in the light of the Creator\" in a realm of pure intelligence.\n[\n60\n]\n\nThe relationship between revelation and philosophy\n[\nedit\n]\n\nIn the view of al-Kindi, prophecy and philosophy were two different routes to arrive at the truth.

Fourthly, the way in which the prophet is able to express this understanding to the ordinary people is superior.

However, the crucial implication is that the \ncontent\n of the prophet's and the philosopher's knowledge is the \nsame\n. This, says Adamson, demonstrates how limited the superiority al-Kindi afforded to prophecy was.\n[\n61\n]\n[\n62\n]\n\nIn addition to this, al-Kindi adopted a naturalistic view of prophetic visions. He argued that, through the faculty of \"imagination\" as conceived of in Aristotelian philosophy, certain \"pure\" and well-prepared souls, were able to receive information about future events. Significantly, he does not attribute such visions or dreams to revelation from God, but instead explains that imagination enables human beings to receive the \"form\" of something without needing to perceive the physical entity to which it refers. Therefore, it would seem to imply that anyone who has purified themselves would be able to receive such visions.

But it would be incorrect to assume that they opposed philosophy simply because it was a \"foreign science\". \nOliver Leaman\n, an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at. Even \nal-Ghazali\n, who is famous for his critique of the philosophers, was himself an expert in philosophy and \nlogic\n. And his criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions. The three most serious of these, in his view, were believing in the co-eternity of the universe with God, denying the bodily resurrection, and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals, not of particular things (not all philosophers subscribed to these same views).\n[\n64\n]\n\nDuring his life, al-Kindi was fortunate enough to enjoy the patronage of the pro-\nMutazilite\n Caliphs \nal-Ma'mun\n and \nal-Mu'tasim\n, which meant he could carry out his philosophical speculations with relative ease.

Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}} This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the [[plainchant]] tradition.<ref>{{harvnb|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists §5",

    "content": "Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}}\n\nDuring the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called [[mensural notation]] grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' (\"The art of measured chant\") by [[Franco of Cologne]] (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in [[European classical music]] today.\n\nEdit summary\n \n(Briefly describe your changes)\n\nBy publishing changes, you agree to the \nTerms of Use\n, and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the \nCC BY-SA 4.0 License\n and the \nGFDL\n.

Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation rather than an objective measurement of sound.{{sfn|Hartmann|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nSpecific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign [[concert A]] (the A above [[middle C]] on the piano) to the frequency of 440&nbsp;Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435&nbsp;Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in [[historically informed performance]] of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.\n\nThe difference in pitch between two notes is called an [[interval (music)|interval]]. The most basic interval is the [[unison]], which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The [[octave]] interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of [[pitch class]]: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single \"class\" by ignoring",

Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In [[Western culture]], there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as [[equal temperament]] is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.\n\n===Scales and modes===\n{{Main|Musical scale| Musical mode}}\n[[File:C major scale.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A pattern of whole and half steps in the Ionian mode or major scale on C[[File:Ionian mode C.mid]]]]\nNotes can be arranged in a variety of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[musical mode|modes]]. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve pitches, called a [[chromatic scale]], within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a [[semitone]], or half step. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales",

Other examples of scales are the [[octatonic scale]] and the [[pentatonic]] or five-tone scale, which is common in [[folk music]] and [[blues]]. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical [[Ottoman classical music|Ottoman]], [[Persian classical music|Persian]], [[Indian classical music|Indian]] and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)—they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nIn traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a [[key signature]] at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale.

Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a [[whole tone]]. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch [[range (music)|range]] compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1935|loc=73–74}}\n\nThe interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the [[circle of fifths]]. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the [[doctrine of the affections]], were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. [[Indian classical music]] theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and",

Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of ''staccato.''

All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer.

Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the conductor are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.\n\nIn Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western Classical music, conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten [[chord chart]] indicating the song's [[chord progression]] using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.).

Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation rather than an objective measurement of sound.{{sfn|Hartmann|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nSpecific frequencies are often assigned letter names.

Thus, in [[historically informed performance]] of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.\n\nThe difference in pitch between two notes is called an [[interval (music)|interval]]. The most basic interval is the [[unison]], which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The [[octave]] interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of [[pitch class]]: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single \"class\" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class—the class that contains all C's.{{Sfn|Bartlette and Laitz|2010|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}\n\n[[Musical tuning]] systems, or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In [[Western culture]], there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system",

Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical [[Ottoman classical music|Ottoman]], [[Persian classical music|Persian]], [[Indian classical music|Indian]] and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)—they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nIn traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a [[key signature]] at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to",

Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch [[range (music)|range]] compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1935|loc=73–74}}\n\nThe interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the [[circle of fifths]]. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the [[doctrine of the affections]], were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. [[Indian classical music]] theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.\n\nEdit summary\n \n(Briefly describe your changes)\n\nBy publishing changes, you agree to the \nTerms of Use\n, and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the \nCC BY-SA 4.0 License",
