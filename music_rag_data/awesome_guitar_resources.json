For the most part it is a bad idea to share your music with non-musicians when you’re a beginner.\n\n The biggest issue is their lack of technical understanding of the instrument. Non-musicians are exposed to so many great guitarists these days though tiktok and YouTube that they think it’s an easy instrument to learn. It’s sort of like how a large % of people think they could hold their own in the NBA when they’ve never played basketball. Most non-musicians think they could become an intermediate player within a couple weeks of practice instead of years.\n\n Non-musicians will also focus on distractions instead of the actual music. Is your recording poor quality? Is there a noise in the background? Do you have a amp that cracks and pops? Did you make a funny face while playing? Do they not like the color of your guitar? These are the things they will comment on instead of the music.\n\n They will",

    "content": "has been designed inclusively. For us, this means broadening our topics beyond the standard harmony and atonal theory topics to include fundamentals, musical form, jazz, pop, rhythm, and orchestration. And within those traditional sections of harmony and atonal theory, the authors have deliberately chosen composers who represent diverse genders and races. The book is accessible. And perhaps most importantly, the book is completely free and always will be.\nThe text of the book is augmented with several different media: video lessons, audio, interactive notated scores with playback, and small quizzes are embedded directly into each chapter for easy access.\nOMT2\n introduces a full workbook to accompany the text. Almost every chapter offers at least one worksheet on that topic. Some chapters, especially in the Fundamentals section, also collect additional assignments that can be found on other websites.\nVersion 2 of this textbook is collaboratively authored and edited by Mark Gotham, Kyle Gullings, Chelsey Hamm, Bryn Hughes, Brian Jarvis, Megan Lavengood, and John Peterson. \n\nAuthors\n\nMark Gotham; Kyle Gullings; Chelsey Hamm; Bryn Hughes; Brian Jarvis; Megan Lavengood; and John Peterson\n\nLicense\n\nOpen Music Theory\n Copyright © 2023 by \nMark Gotham; Kyle Gullings; Chelsey Hamm; Bryn Hughes; Brian Jarvis; Megan Lavengood; and John Peterson\n is licensed under a \nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0",
