    "content": "has been designed inclusively. For us, this means broadening our topics beyond the standard harmony and atonal theory topics to include fundamentals, musical form, jazz, pop, rhythm,¬†and orchestration. And within those traditional sections of harmony and atonal theory, the authors have deliberately chosen composers who represent diverse genders and races. The book is accessible. And perhaps most importantly, the book is completely free and always will be.\nThe text of the book is augmented with several different media: video lessons, audio, interactive notated scores with playback, and small quizzes are embedded directly into each chapter for easy access.\nOMT2\n introduces a full workbook to accompany the text. Almost every chapter offers at least one worksheet on that topic. Some chapters, especially in the Fundamentals section, also collect additional assignments that can be found on other websites.\nVersion 2 of this textbook is collaboratively authored and edited by Mark Gotham, Kyle Gullings, Chelsey Hamm, Bryn Hughes, Brian Jarvis, Megan Lavengood, and John Peterson. \n\nAuthors\n\nMark Gotham; Kyle Gullings; Chelsey Hamm; Bryn Hughes; Brian Jarvis; Megan Lavengood; and John Peterson\n\nLicense\n\nOpen Music Theory\n Copyright ¬© 2023 by \nMark Gotham; Kyle Gullings; Chelsey Hamm; Bryn Hughes; Brian Jarvis; Megan Lavengood; and John Peterson\n is licensed under a \nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0",

I'm in both Orchestra (cello) and Choir (soprano), I'm self-learning the guitar and piano, and I compose for fun on the side as well. I think APMT would be a great addition to this, so I'm heavily considering taking it. I also have a good friend taking the class, so I wouldn't be alone. On the other hand, however, my parents think that taking three music-related electives is a little overkill when I plan to go into computer science. I also have many friends taking the same off-period, so if I were to take study hall I would be able to spend time with them. It would also just be free time in general to go home early, study for other classes, or work on college applications. My parents think I should have a laid-back senior year where I don't have to worry too much about classes and spend time with my friends since this is our last year. I also read people discouraging taking APMT in senior year as it's very content heavy and doesn't mix well with second-semester senioritis. I emailed both my choir and orchestra teachers about it, and my orch teacher encouraged me to take it while my choir teacher said I can take it if I want to, but warned me that it's not a class that you can treat as a throwaway. One of my friends also had a friend",
