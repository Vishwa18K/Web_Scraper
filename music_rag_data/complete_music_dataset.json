But over time, something deeper begins to take shape…\n\nYou start to realize that soloing isn’t just about hitting the right notes or outlining the changes – it’s about \nmotion\n. The sense that your solo is going somewhere…telling a \nstory\n.…\nmoving\n forward through the form.\n\nIt comes down to the simple and timeless concept of \ntension and release\n. And this is something the best players don’t leave up to chance, they have specific techniques to create musical momentum.\n\nAs an improviser, the more tactics you have for creating this kind of motion, the more powerful your solos will become. \n\nIn this lesson for \nPremium members\n we’re going to explore how to shape not only the larger arc of your solos, but the specific movement through the established form of a tune.\n\nInside you’ll learn:\n\n7 essential dominant resolutions\n for creating forward motion \n\nThe key \ntransition points\n in the blues\n\nSpecific lines\n utilizing these concepts\n\nAnd how \nHerbie Hancock\n & \nMcCoy Tyner\n \nmanipulate tension and ...\n\nHey, Sorry to Interrupt...\n\nI know you were really enjoying this lesson and super excited to learn something new, but we",

Si Si\n\nParker’s tune \nSi Si\n, an F blues, was recorded during the same 1951 session that produced \nBlues for Alice\n and featured players like Red Rodney, John Lewis, Ray Brown, and Kenny Clarke.\n\nThe melody to \nSi Si\n contains many elements of a bebop blues, however the second bar presents a curve ball, with an E natural, C#, and A natural in the melody – creating dissonance before returning to diatonic material in the 3rd bar.",

    "content": "Bill Evans: 4 Tools for Creating Harmonic Motion\n\n By \n\nEric\n\nChords\n, \nJazz Musicians\n, \nJazz Standards\n, \nPremium\n\nBill Evans\n\nFor any improviser learning jazz standards, one of the greatest challenges isn’t just learning the chords to a tune – it’s \nmaking music\n with them when you take a solo.\n\nAnd this can be tricky, because the harmony on the page is just a starting point. The real magic begins when you start to move \nbeyond\n what’s written. \n\nYou see, great improvisers don’t simply follow the chords – they reshape them, weaving in color, motion, and tension. This is the difference between static harmony and what we might call \nliving harmony\n: a fluid, expressive approach that turns even the most familiar progression into something personal.\n\nAnd few musicians embodied this better than \nBill Evans\n…\n\nIn this \nPremium lesson\n, we’ll explore how Evans approached harmony with remarkable freedom and clarity. \n\nAnd through the lens of a classic jazz standard, we’ll break down \n4 powerful harmonic tools\n he used to navigate—and elevate—any progression, tools that will open up doors in your own playing.\n\nLet’s dive in…\n\nMusic Theory vs. The Practice of Harmony\n\nAs you’ve probably realized by now, there’s a difference between memorizing the chords to a jazz standard ...\n\nHey, Sorry to Interrupt...\n\nI know you were really enjoying this lesson and super excited to learn",

And that these holes cause most of the problems that are holding you back from playing jazz tunes the way you want to?\n\nJazz theory today is based on \n“modal”\n thinking – A bunch of scales that you quickly memorize and apply to each chord using various rules…\n\nAnd this method is fine for getting your foot in the door, but fails as you try to move up to the next level because it skips over some of the key components of what’s \nactually\n going on in the music.\n\nNow I learned this the hard way…\n\nI went years memorizing chords to tunes and applying scales to them without a complete understanding of what was really going on in the changes. I was in the dark, and deep down I knew it. I had a million questions as to why certain things were the way they were in jazz, and I couldn’t find the answers anywhere.\n\nAfter years of struggling, I figured out that the thing I lacked then is exactly what so many others are lacking today: \nA Strong Understanding of Harmony\n.\n\nAnd the great news is, you don’t have to waste years to acquire this skill and figure everything out on your own like I did. In this course, we’ve paved your way to understanding harmony and theory once and for all.",

And sadly, this skill has been lost in the modern approach to jazz theory.\n\nIn this course you’ll rediscover this lost skill of the masters.\n\nUsing the fundamental principles inside, you’ll learn to see harmony and chord progressions in a new light. No more guessing why a chord is there in the progression, and no more fumbling through the chord changes trying to connect two seemingly unrelated chords…\n\nEverything is related and connected, but no one ever bothered to teach you how. And this is what’s holding you back…\n\nYour ability to play a jazz solo the way you want to, compose easily, and improvise creatively is directly related to how you understand harmony – this is why you need this course, because to really play a tune, you have to understand functional harmony on a deep level, where everything comes from, and how everything is related.\n\nLet’s",

    "content": "to this point in your jazz improvisation journey, it’s probably been a mystery as to what’s harmonically possible at a any given time. This leads to a world of confusion and misunderstanding. But with the multiple frameworks we give you on Major and Minor Harmony, and how to get beyond them, you’ll have a clear view of harmonic possibility once and for all.\n\nIf you’re operating with only pieces of information or an incomplete view, it’s time to remedy that by learning the whole system that we share with you in this course.\n\nWhat makes Jazz Theory Unlocked different?\n\nThis course certainly is different.\n\nInstead of giving you a bunch of scale choices and showing you how to apply them to chords like most jazz theory today is all about, this course gives you a strong foundation in harmony…\n\nIn 5 parts, with over 60 videos, you’ll learn…\n\nWhere chords actually come from and how they behave\n\nHow to build Major Harmony from the ground up, every detail\n\nHow to build Minor Harmony and all the issues that trip everyone up\n\nHow Major & Minor harmony interact and connect\n\nHow jazz musicians can expand their harmonic universe\n\nThe deeper side of dominant chords and alterations\n\nThe true role of diminished chords and how to approach them\n\nHow chords move and all the reasons behind why\n\nHow tunes are put together and what makes them stand out\n\nHow composers use a particular way of thinking to achieve the unexpected\n\nBy using a unique way to teach you the complex concepts of music theory and",

    "content": "harmony, \nJazz Theory Unlocked\n explores all this and a whole lot more…\n\nRather than making you study a dense theory book and boring you with loads of scales or rules that don’t ultimately help you, we’ve constructed fun and engaging video lectures that break down everything you need to know in a clear and concise way.\n\nHere’s what makes the course & teaching style so special…\n\nIt’s Super Visual\n – Most jazz theory books, classes, or programs are built around standard music notation and classical musical excerpts. This isn’t. In this course we present the information in a highly visual way including tons of diagrams and drawings that will aid in your ability to mentally conceptualize harmony. This is a game changer for jazz musicians who need everything functioning clearly in their mind.\n\nIt’s Fun & Engaging\n – Forget the dull and dry theory you’re used to…this course teaches you in a fun and casual manner, something everyone can relate to. Through this entertaining style, you’ll easily retain the information and understand it on a deep level. You won’t be falling asleep or struggling with technical jargon.\n\nIt Guides You Through Every Detail\n – More often than not, jazz theory today skips important steps while attempting to teach vital concepts, glossing over the many details that matter. Instead, we guide you the entire way, making sure that these important details don’t slip through the cracks because when it comes to jazz, a lot of your understanding comes directly from these subtle details.\n\nIt’s",

In the videos, we’ve shared with you our \naha\n moments, giving you the insights you need to break through.\n\nIt Highlights the Differences With Jazz\n – Most music theory today is a hodgepodge of classical music theory, modal thinking, and scale application, but none of these actually get to the heart of the matter. Jazz is different than any other music and it’s time that a theory course take that into account. We do, which allows us to shed light on problems that have been completely ignored by modern jazz education. When you treat jazz as the unique music it is, the theory becomes a lot more clear.\n\nAll you have to do is watch and learn as we illustrate key components of jazz theory that have never been given the necessary attention. Simply go at your pace, pause the videos on key diagrams and review the information as much as you like.\n\nAnd when you’re ready, you can work on the lesson assignments to strengthen everything you’ve learned and put it into practice. With this course you’ll gain a deeper understanding of jazz theory and harmony than ever before…\n\nEvery great jazz musician has a deep understanding of harmony.

Music is a very large subject, and the advanced theory that students will want to pursue after mastering the basics will vary greatly. A trumpet player interested in jazz, a vocalist interested in early music, a pianist interested in classical composition, and a guitarist interested in world music, will all want to delve into very different facets of music theory; although, interestingly, if they all become very well-versed in their chosen fields, they will still end up very capable of understanding each other and cooperating in musical endeavors. The final section of this course does include a few challenges that are generally not considered \"beginner level\" musicianship, but are very useful in just about every field and genre of music.\n\nThe main purpose of the course, however, is to explore basic music theory so thoroughly that the interested student will then be able to easily pick up whatever further theory is wanted. Music history and the physics of sound are included to the extent that they shed light on music",

Students who find the section on acoustics (The Physical Basis) uninteresting may skip it at first, but should then go back to it when they begin to want to understand why musical sounds work the way they do. Remember, the main premise of this course is that a better understanding of where the basics come from will lead to better and faster comprehension of more complex ideas.\n\nIt also helps to remember, however, that music theory is a bit like grammar. Languages are invented by the people who speak them, who tend to care more about what is easy and what makes sense than about following rules. Later, experts study the best speakers and writers in order to discover how they use language. These language theorists then make up rules that clarify grammar and spelling and point out the relationships between words. Those rules are only guidelines based on patterns discovered by the theoreticians, which is why there are usually plenty of \"exceptions\" to every rule. Attempts to develop a new language by first inventing the grammar and spelling never seem to result in a language that people find useful.\n\nMusic theory, too, always comes along after a group of composers and performers have already developed a musical tradition. Theoreticians then study the resulting music and discover good ways of explaining it to the audience and to other composers and performers. So sometimes the answer to \"Why is it that way?\" is simply \"that's what is easiest for the performer\", or \"they borrowed that from an earlier music tradition\".\n\nIn the",

Adults who have already had some music instruction should be able to work through this course with or without a teacher; simply use the opening sections to review any concepts that are unclear or half-forgotten. Young students and beginning musicians should go through it with a teacher, in either a classroom or lesson setting.\n\nThere is, even within the English-speaking world, quite a variety of music teaching traditions, which sometimes use different terms for the same concepts.

Every time you want to send an assignment to your students, you can create a smaller workbook and import lessons or modules from that 'master workbook' using the \nTools-->Import lessons from workbook\n option in the \nWorkbook Editor\n.\n\nThat way, when the year has passed, you will have a all the assignments from the passed year nicely gathered into a single workbook, ready to be reused next year.\n\n Sign up for the EarMaster Educational Newsletter\n\r\nSign up for our educational newsletter to be updated about new releases, new features, tips to use EarMaster in educational settings, promotional offers, webinars, and more.",

For the most part it is a bad idea to share your music with non-musicians when you’re a beginner.\n\n The biggest issue is their lack of technical understanding of the instrument. Non-musicians are exposed to so many great guitarists these days though tiktok and YouTube that they think it’s an easy instrument to learn. It’s sort of like how a large % of people think they could hold their own in the NBA when they’ve never played basketball. Most non-musicians think they could become an intermediate player within a couple weeks of practice instead of years.\n\n Non-musicians will also focus on distractions instead of the actual music. Is your recording poor quality? Is there a noise in the background? Do you have a amp that cracks and pops? Did you make a funny face while playing? Do they not like the color of your guitar? These are the things they will comment on instead of the music.\n\n They will",

    "content": "has been designed inclusively. For us, this means broadening our topics beyond the standard harmony and atonal theory topics to include fundamentals, musical form, jazz, pop, rhythm, and orchestration. And within those traditional sections of harmony and atonal theory, the authors have deliberately chosen composers who represent diverse genders and races. The book is accessible. And perhaps most importantly, the book is completely free and always will be.\nThe text of the book is augmented with several different media: video lessons, audio, interactive notated scores with playback, and small quizzes are embedded directly into each chapter for easy access.\nOMT2\n introduces a full workbook to accompany the text. Almost every chapter offers at least one worksheet on that topic. Some chapters, especially in the Fundamentals section, also collect additional assignments that can be found on other websites.\nVersion 2 of this textbook is collaboratively authored and edited by Mark Gotham, Kyle Gullings, Chelsey Hamm, Bryn Hughes, Brian Jarvis, Megan Lavengood, and John Peterson. \n\nAuthors\n\nMark Gotham; Kyle Gullings; Chelsey Hamm; Bryn Hughes; Brian Jarvis; Megan Lavengood; and John Peterson\n\nLicense\n\nOpen Music Theory\n Copyright © 2023 by \nMark Gotham; Kyle Gullings; Chelsey Hamm; Bryn Hughes; Brian Jarvis; Megan Lavengood; and John Peterson\n is licensed under a \nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0",
