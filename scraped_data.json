As an open and natively-online resource,\nOMT2\nis substantially different from other commercially-published music theory textbooks, though it still provides the same content that teachers expect from a music theory text.\nOMT2\nhas been designed inclusively. For us, this means broadening our topics beyond the standard harmony and atonal theory topics to include fundamentals, musical form, jazz, pop, rhythm,\u00a0and orchestration. And within those traditional sections of harmony and atonal theory, the authors have deliberately chosen composers who represent diverse genders and races. The book is accessible. And perhaps most importantly, the book is completely free and always will be.\nThe text of the book is augmented with several different media: video lessons, audio, interactive notated scores with playback, and small quizzes are embedded directly into each chapter for easy access.\nOMT2\nintroduces a full workbook to accompany the text. Almost every chapter offers at least one worksheet on that topic. Some chapters, especially in the Fundamentals section, also collect additional assignments that can be found on other websites.\nVersion 2 of this textbook is collaboratively authored and edited by Mark Gotham, Kyle Gullings, Chelsey Hamm, Bryn Hughes, Brian Jarvis, Megan Lavengood, and John Peterson.\nAuthors\nMark Gotham; Kyle Gullings; Chelsey Hamm; Bryn Hughes; Brian Jarvis; Megan Lavengood; and John Peterson\nLicense\nOpen Music Theory\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 by\nMark Gotham; Kyle Gullings; Chelsey Hamm; Bryn Hughes; Brian Jarvis; Megan Lavengood; and John Peterson\nis licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License\n, except where otherwise noted.\nSubject\nTheory of music and musicology\nMetadata\nTitle\nOpen Music Theory\nAuthors\nMark Gotham; Kyle Gullings; Chelsey Hamm; Bryn Hughes; Brian Jarvis; Megan Lavengood; and John Peterson\nEditor\nErin K.

The musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis \"in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.\"\n[\n1\n]\nMusic theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including\ntuning systems\nand composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of\nwhat constitutes music\n, a more inclusive definition could be the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence. This is not an absolute guideline, however; for example, the study of \"music\" in the\nQuadrivium\nliberal arts university\ncurriculum, that was common in\nmedieval Europe\n, was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice.\n[\nn 1\n]\nBut this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries and is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.\n[\nn 2\n]\nMusic theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts that composers and other musicians use in creating and performing music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions,\nmusical instruments\n, and other\nartifacts\n. For example, ancient instruments from\nprehistoric\nsites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers. In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music-making. Many cultures have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written\ntreatises\nand\nmusic notation\n. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as\nscholarly writing\ncites earlier research.\nIn modern academia, music theory is a subfield of\nmusicology\n, the wider study of musical cultures and history.\nGuido Adler\n, however, in one of the texts that founded musicology in the late 19th century, wrote that \"the science of music originated at the same time as the art of sounds\",\n[\n3\n]\nwhere \"the science of music\" (\nMusikwissenschaft\n) obviously meant \"music theory\". Adler added that music only could exist when one began measuring pitches and comparing them to each other. He concluded that \"all people for which one can speak of an art of sounds also have a science of sounds\".\n[\n4\n]\nOne must deduce that music theory exists in all musical cultures of the world.\nMusic theory is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as\ntuning\nand tonal systems,\nscales\n,\nconsonance and dissonance\n, and rhythmic relationships. There is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music,\norchestration\n,\nornamentation\n, improvisation, and\nelectronic sound\nproduction.\n[\n5\n]\nA person who researches or teaches music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the\nMA\nor\nPhD\nlevel, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory\ntextbooks\n, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of\nmusical acoustics\n, considerations of\nmusical notation\n, and techniques of tonal\ncomposition\n(\nharmony\nand\ncounterpoint\n), among other topics.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nHistory of music\nAntiquity\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nAncient music\nMesopotamia\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nMusic of Mesopotamia\nSeveral surviving\nSumerian\nand\nAkkadian\nclay tablets\ninclude musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of\nintervals\nand\ntunings\n.\n[\n6\n]\nThe scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500\u00a0BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, \"All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years.\"\n[\n7\n]\nChina\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nMusic of China\nand\nChinese musicology\nMuch of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.\n[\n8\n]\nChinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed, Five refers to the Pentatonic Scale (primarily uses a 5-note scale), And Eight refers to the eight categories of Chinese Music Instruments; classified by the material they are made from: (Metal, Stone, Silk, Bamboo, Gourd, Clay, Leather, and Wood). The\nL\u00fcshi chunqiu\nfrom about 238\u00a0BCE recalls the legend of\nLing Lun\n. On order of the\nYellow Emperor\n, Ling Lun collected twelve\nbamboo\nlengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it\nhuangzhong\n, the \"Yellow Bell.\" He then heard\nphoenixes\nsinging. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the\nl\u00fcl\u00fc\nor later the\nshierl\u00fc\n.\n[\n9\n]\nApart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The\nYueji\n(\"Record of music\", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests\nConfucian\nmoral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of\nMozi\n(c. 468 \u2013 c. 376\u00a0BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and\nLaozi\n's claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the\nqin\nzither\n, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with\nDaoist\nreferences, such as\nTianfeng huanpei\n(\"Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants\").\n[\n8\n]\nIndia\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nMusic of India\nThe\nSamaveda\nand\nYajurveda\n(c. 1200 \u2013 1000\u00a0BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but properly speaking, they contain no theory. The\nNatya Shastra\n, written between 200\u00a0BCE to 200\u00a0CE, discusses intervals (\n\u015arutis\n), scales (\nGr\u0101mas\n), consonances and dissonances, classes of melodic structure (\nM\u016brchan\u0101s\n, modes?), melodic types (\nJ\u0101tis\n), instruments, etc.\n[\n10\n]\nGreece\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nMusical system of ancient Greece\nand\nList of music theorists \u00a7\u00a0Antiquity\nEarly preserved Greek writings on music theory include two types of works:\n[\n11\n]\ntechnical manuals describing the Greek musical system including notation, scales, consonance and dissonance, rhythm, and types of musical compositions;\ntreatises on the way in which music reveals universal patterns of order leading to the highest levels of knowledge and understanding.\nSeveral names of theorists are known before these works, including\nPythagoras\n(\nc.\n570\n~\nc.\n495\nBCE\n),\nPhilolaus\n(\nc.\n470 ~ (\nc.\n385\nBCE\n),\nArchytas\n(428\u2013347\nBCE\n), and others.\nWorks of the first type (technical manuals) include\nAnonymous (erroneously attributed to\nEuclid\n) (1989) [4th\u2013\n3rd century\nBCE\n].

Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century.\n[\n21\n]\nThis treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the\nplainchant\ntradition.\n[\n22\n]\nAt the end of the ninth century,\nHucbald\nworked towards more precise pitch notation for the\nneumes\nused to record plainchant.\nGuido d'Arezzo\nwrote a letter to Michael of Pomposa in 1028, entitled\nEpistola de ignoto cantu\n,\n[\n23\n]\nin which he introduced the practice of using syllables to describe notes and intervals. This was the source of the hexachordal\nsolmization\nthat was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony \"come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account\" in the Western tradition.\n[\n21\n]\nDuring the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called\nmensural notation\ngrew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise\nArs cantus mensurabilis\n(\"The art of measured chant\") by\nFranco of Cologne\n(c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in\nEuropean classical music\ntoday.\nModern\n[\nedit\n]\nMiddle Eastern and Central Asian countries\n[\nedit\n]\nB\u0101qiy\u0101 N\u0101yin\u1fd1 (Uzbekistan, 17th century CE), Uzbek author and music theorist.

For example, the long and rich musical traditions unique to ancient and current cultures of Africa are primarily oral, but describe specific forms, genres, performance practices, tunings, and other aspects of music theory.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n25\n]\nSacred harp\nmusic uses a different kind of scale and theory in practice. The music focuses on the solfege \"fa, sol, la\" on the music scale. Sacred Harp also employs a different notation involving \"shape notes\", or notes that are shaped to correspond to a certain solfege syllable on the music scale. Sacred Harp music and its music theory originated with Reverend Thomas Symmes in 1720, where he developed a system for \"singing by note\" to help his church members with note accuracy.\n[\n26\n]\nFurther information:\nList of music theorists \u00a7\u00a019th century\nContemporary\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of music theorists \u00a7\u00a020th century\n, and\nList of music theorists \u00a7\u00a021st century\nFundamentals of music\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nAspect of music\nMusic is composed of\naural\nphenomena; \"music theory\" considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.\n[\n27\n]\nPitch\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nPitch (music)\nMiddle C (261.626\u00a0Hz)\nPitch is the lowness or highness of a\ntone\n, for example the difference between\nmiddle C\nand a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation rather than an objective measurement of sound.\n[\n28\n]\nSpecific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign\nconcert A\n(the A above\nmiddle C\non the piano) to the frequency of 440\u00a0Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435\u00a0Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in\nhistorically informed performance\nof older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.\nThe difference in pitch between two notes is called an\ninterval\n. The most basic interval is the\nunison\n, which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The\noctave\ninterval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of\npitch class\n: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single \"class\" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class\u2014the class that contains all C's.\n[\n29\n]\nMusical tuning\nsystems, or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In\nWestern culture\n, there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as\nequal temperament\nis most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.\nScales and modes\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nMusical scale\nand\nMusical mode\nA pattern of whole and half steps in the Ionian mode or major scale on C\nNotes can be arranged in a variety of\nscales\nand\nmodes\n. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve pitches, called a\nchromatic scale\n, within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a\nsemitone\n, or half step. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.\n[\n30\n]\nThe most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned\nmajor\n, the\nharmonic minor\n, the\nmelodic minor\n, and the\nnatural minor\n. Other examples of scales are the\noctatonic scale\nand the\npentatonic\nor five-tone scale, which is common in\nfolk music\nand\nblues\n. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical\nOttoman\n,\nPersian\n,\nIndian\nand\nArabic\nmusical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)\u2014they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.\n[\n30\n]\nIn traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a\nkey signature\nat the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be\ntransposed\nfrom one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a\nwhole tone\n. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch\nrange\ncompared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.\n[\n31\n]\nThe interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the\ncircle of fifths\n. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the\ndoctrine of the affections\n, were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others.\nIndian classical music\ntheory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.\nConsonance and dissonance\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nConsonance and dissonance\nPerfect octave\n, a consonant interval\nMinor second\n, a dissonant interval\nConsonance and dissonance\nare subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages. Consonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and \"wants to\" resolve to a consonant interval. Dissonant intervals seem to clash. Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together. Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant. All others are dissonant to a greater or lesser degree.\n[\n32\n]\nContext and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the\nCommon practice era\n, the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century,\nArnold Schoenberg\n's concept of \"emancipated\" dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as \"higher,\" more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.\n[\n32\n]\nRhythm\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nRhythm\nMetric levels\n: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below\nRhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time.\nMeter\nmeasures music in regular pulse groupings, called\nmeasures or bars\n. The\ntime signature\nor meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.\nThrough increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented. There are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter.\nSyncopated\nrhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat.\n[\n33\n]\nPlaying simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called\npolyrhythm\n.\n[\n34\n]\nIn recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. The most highly cited of these recent scholars are\nMaury Yeston\n,\n[\n35\n]\nFred Lerdahl\nand\nRay Jackendoff\n,\n[\n36\n]\nJonathan Kramer\n,\n[\n37\n]\nand Justin London.\n[\n38\n]\nMelody\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMelody\n\"\nPop Goes the Weasel\n\" melody\n[\n39\n]\nA\nmelody\nis a group of musical sounds in agreeable succession or arrangement.\n[\n40\n]\nBecause melody is such a prominent aspect in so much music, its construction and other qualities are a primary interest of music theory.\nThe basic elements of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as\nscales\nor\nmodes\n. Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.\n[\n41\n]\nChord\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nChord (music)\nC major triad represented in\nstaff notation\n.\nPlay\n\u24d8\nin\njust intonation\nPlay\n\u24d8\nin\nEqual temperament\nPlay\n\u24d8\nin\n1/4-comma meantone\nPlay\n\u24d8\nin\nYoung temperament\nPlay\n\u24d8\nin\nPythagorean tuning\nA chord, in music, is any\nharmonic\nset of three or more\nnotes\nthat is heard as if sounding\nsimultaneously\n.\n[\n42\n]\n:\npp. 67,\u200a359\n[\n43\n]\n:\np. 63\nThese need not actually be played together:\narpeggios\nand broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords.

The most\ncommon chords\nare the\nmajor\nand\nminor\ntriads\nand then the\naugmented\nand\ndiminished\ntriads\n. The descriptions\nmajor\n,\nminor\n,\naugmented\n, and\ndiminished\nare sometimes referred to collectively as chordal\nquality\n. Chords are also commonly classed by their\nroot\nnote\u2014so, for instance, the chord\nC\nmajor may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note\nC\n. Chords may also be classified by\ninversion\n, the order in which the notes are stacked.\nA series of chords is called a\nchord progression\n. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing\nkey\nin\ncommon-practice harmony\n. To describe this, chords are numbered, using\nRoman numerals\n(upward from the key-note),\n[\n47\n]\nper their\ndiatonic function\n. Common ways of\nnotating or representing chords\n[\n48\n]\nin western music other than conventional\nstaff notation\ninclude\nRoman numerals\n,\nfigured bass\n(much used in the\nBaroque era\n),\nchord letters\n(sometimes used in modern\nmusicology\n), and various systems of\nchord charts\ntypically found in the\nlead sheets\nused in\npopular music\nto lay out the sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo.\nHarmony\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHarmony\nBarbershop quartets\n, such as this US Navy group, sing 4-part pieces, made up of a melody line (normally the second-highest voice, called the \"lead\") and 3 harmony parts.\nIn music, harmony is the use of simultaneous\npitches\n(\ntones\n,\nnotes\n), or\nchords\n.\n[\n46\n]\n:\np. 15\nThe study of harmony involves chords and their construction and\nchord progressions\nand the principles of connection that govern them.\n[\n49\n]\nHarmony is often said to refer to the \"vertical\" aspect of music, as distinguished from\nmelodic line\n, or the \"horizontal\" aspect.\n[\n50\n]\nCounterpoint\n, which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and\npolyphony\n, which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, is thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.\n[\n51\n]\nIn\npopular\nand\njazz harmony\n, chords are named by their\nroot\nplus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. For example, a\nlead sheet\nmay indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with \"tensions\". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively\ndissonant interval\nin relation to the bass. It is part of a chord, but is not one of the chord tones (1 3 5 7). Typically, in the classical\ncommon practice period\na dissonant chord (chord with tension) \"resolves\" to a consonant chord.\nHarmonization\nusually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between \"tense\" and \"relaxed\" moments.\n[\n52\n]\n[\nunreliable source?\n]\nTimbre\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nTimbre\nSpectrogram\nof the first second of an E9 chord played on a Fender Stratocaster guitar with noiseless pickups. Below is the E9 chord audio:\nTimbre, sometimes called \"color\", or \"tone color,\" is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature. It has been called \"... the psychoacoustician's multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,\"\n[\n53\n]\nbut can be accurately described and analyzed by\nFourier analysis\nand other methods\n[\n54\n]\nbecause it results from the combination of all sound\nfrequencies\n, attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.\nTimbre\nis principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of\novertones\nproduced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the\nenvelope\nof the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nA voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word\ndolce\n(sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and \"sweet\" timbre.\nSul tasto\ninstructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound.\nCuivre\ninstructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound.

In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.\nThe conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like\nforte\n(\nf\n) for loud and\npiano\n(\np\n) for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including\nmezzo piano\n(\nmp\n) for moderately soft (literally \"half soft\") and\nmezzo forte\n(\nmf\n) for moderately loud,\nsforzando\nor\nsforzato\n(\nsfz\n) for a surging or \"pushed\" attack, or\nfortepiano\n(\nfp\n) for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level.

Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (\ncrescendo\n) or decreasing volume (\ndiminuendo\nor\ndecrescendo\n), often called \"\nhairpins\n\" when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.\nArticulation\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\ndoes not\ncite\nany\nsources\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this section\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\n.

From left to right:\nstaccato\n,\nstaccatissimo\n,\nmartellato\n,\naccent\n,\ntenuto\n.\nArticulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example,\nstaccato\nis the shortening of duration compared to the written note value,\nlegato\nperforms the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.\nFor example,\nstaccato\nis often referred to as \"separated\" or \"detached\" rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of\nstaccato.\nThe manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).\nThere is a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are\u2014from long to short:\nlegato\n(smooth, connected);\ntenuto\n(pressed or played to full notated duration);\nmarcato\n(accented and detached);\nstaccato\n(\"separated\", \"detached\");\nmartel\u00e9\n(heavily accented or \"hammered\").\n[\ncontradictory\n]\nMany of these can be combined to create certain \"in-between\" articulations. For example,\nportato\nis the combination of\ntenuto\nand\nstaccato\n. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as\nspiccato\nfor bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.\nTexture\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusical texture\nIntroduction to\nSousa\n's \"\nWashington Post March\n,\" mm. 1\u20137 features\noctave doubling\n[\n56\n]\nand a homorhythmic texture\nIn music, texture is how the\nmelodic\n,\nrhythmic\n, and\nharmonic\nmaterials are combined in a\ncomposition\n, thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and\nrange\n, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many \"layers\" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.\nThe thickness also is affected by the number and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the\ntimbre\nof the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony,\ntempo\n, and rhythms used.\n[\n57\n]\nThe types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.\n[\n58\n]\n[\nincomplete short citation\n]\nCommon types included\nmonophonic\ntexture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody),\npolyphonic\ntexture and\nhomophonic\ntexture (chords accompanying a melody).\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nForm or structure\n[\nedit\n]\nA musical\ncanon\n.\nEncyclopaedia Britannica\ncalls a \"canon\" both a compositional technique and a musical form.\n[\n59\n]\nMain article:\nMusical form\nThe term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.\n[\n60\n]\nIn the tenth edition of\nThe Oxford Companion to Music\n,\nPercy Scholes\ndefines musical form as \"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\"\n[\n61\n]\nAccording to\nRichard Middleton\n, musical form is \"the shape or structure of the work.\" He describes it through difference: the distance moved from a\nrepeat\n; the latter being the smallest difference. Difference is quantitative and qualitative:\nhow far\n, and\nof what type\n, different. In many cases, form depends on statement and\nrestatement\n, unity and variety, and\ncontrast\nand connection.\n[\n62\n]\nExpression\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusical expression\nA violinist performing\nMusical expression is the art of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano,\nphrasing\n, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.\nExpression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions.\n[\nclarification needed\n]\nWhether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable\nemotion\n, ideally causing a\nsympathetic emotional response\nin its listeners.\n[\n63\n]\nThe emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a\nnational anthem\n), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.\n[\n64\n]\n[\n65\n]\n[\n66\n]\n[\n67\n]\n[\n68\n]\n[\n69\n]\nNotation\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nMusical notation\nand\nSheet music\nTibetan\nmusical score from the 19th century\nMusical notation is the written or symbolized representation of music. This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation.\n[\n70\n]\nIn the 2000s, computer\nfile formats\nhave become important as well.\n[\n71\n]\nSpoken language and\nhand signs\nare also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.\nIn standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a\nstaff\nor staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the conductor are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.\nIn Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western Classical music, conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten\nchord chart\nindicating the song's\nchord progression\nusing chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.\nAs academic discipline\n[\nedit\n]\nThe scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.\nAnalysis\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nMusical analysis\n,\nSchenkerian analysis\n, and\nTransformational theory\nTypically a given work is analyzed by more than one person and different or divergent analyses are created. For instance, the first two bars of the prelude to\nClaude Debussy\n's\nPell\u00e9as et Melisande\nare analyzed differently by Leibowitz, Laloy, van Appledorn, and Christ. Leibowitz analyses this succession harmonically as D minor:I\u2013VII\u2013V, ignoring melodic motion, Laloy analyses the succession as D:I\u2013V, seeing the G in the second measure as an\nornament\n, and both van Appledorn and Christ analyse the succession as D:I\u2013VII.\nPlay\n\u24d8\nMusical analysis is the attempt to answer the question\nhow does this music work?\nThe method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to\nIan Bent\n, \"analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the\nMiddle Ages\nonwards.\"\n[\n72\n]\n[\nincomplete short citation\n]\nAdolf Bernhard Marx\nwas influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as\nEdgard Var\u00e8se\n's claim that, \"to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work\".\n[\n73\n]\nSchenkerian analysis\nis a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of\nHeinrich Schenker\n(1868\u20131935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining\ntonality\nin music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various\ntechniques of elaboration\n. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of\ntonal space\n.\n[\n74\n]\nThe intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a\ntonal space\nthat is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.\nAlthough Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the\nfundamental structure\n(\nUrsatz\n) to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the\nUrsatz\nis arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise.\n[\n75\n]\nEven at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is\nsubjective\n. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst.\n[\n76\n]\nThe analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.\nTransformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by\nDavid Lewin\nin the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work,\nGeneralized Musical Intervals and Transformations\n. The theory, which models\nmusical transformations\nas elements of a\nmathematical group\n, can be used to analyze both\ntonal\nand\natonal music\n. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects\u2014such as the \"C\nmajor chord\n\" or \"G major chord\"\u2014to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been \"transformed\" into the second by the \"\nDominant\noperation.\" (Symbolically, one might write \"Dominant(C major) = G major.\") While traditional\nmusical set theory\nfocuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the\nintervals\nor types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, \"[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am\nat\ns and wish to get to t, what characteristic\ngesture\nshould I perform in order to arrive there?'\"\n[\n77\n]\nMusic perception and cognition\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nMusic psychology\n,\nFred Lerdahl\n, and\nRay Jackendoff\nMusic psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both\npsychology\nand\nmusicology\n. It aims to explain and understand musical\nbehavior\nand\nexperience\n, including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\nModern music psychology is primarily\nempirical\n; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic\nobservation\nof and interaction with\nhuman participants\n. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music\nperformance\n,\ncomposition\n,\neducation\n,\ncriticism\n, and\ntherapy\n, as well as investigations of human\naptitude\n, skill,\nintelligence\n, creativity, and\nsocial behavior\n.\nMusic psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of\nmusicology\nand musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the\nperception\nand\ncomputational modelling\nof musical structures such as\nmelody\n,\nharmony\n,\ntonality\n,\nrhythm\n,\nmeter\n, and\nform\n. Research in\nmusic history\ncan benefit from systematic study of the history of\nmusical syntax\n, or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music.\nGenre and technique\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nMusic genre\nand\nMusical technique\nA Classical\npiano trio\nis a group that plays\nchamber music\n, including\nsonatas\n. The term \"piano trio\" also refers to works composed for such a group.\nA music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.\n[\n80\n]\nIt is to be distinguished from\nmusical form\nand\nmusical style\n, although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.\n[\n81\n]\n[\nfailed verification\n]\nMusic can be divided into different\ngenres\nin many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term\ngenre\nitself. In his book\nForm in Tonal Music\n, Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and\nform\n. He lists\nmadrigal\n,\nmotet\n,\ncanzona\n,\nricercar\n, and dance as examples of genres from the\nRenaissance\nperiod. To further clarify the meaning of\ngenre\n, Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre\u2014both are violin concertos\u2014but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the\nAgnus Dei\nfrom his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\"\n[\n82\n]\nSome, like\nPeter van der Merwe\n, treat the terms\ngenre\nand\nstyle\nas the same, saying that\ngenre\nshould be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or \"basic musical language.\"\n[\n83\n]\nOthers, such as Allan F. Moore, state that\ngenre\nand\nstyle\nare two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.\n[\n84\n]\nA music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the\nmusical techniques\n, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that \"since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".\n[\n85\n]\nMusical technique is the ability of\ninstrumental\nand vocal musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or\nvocal cords\nto produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the\nnatural\n,\nminor\n,\nmajor\n, and\nchromatic scales\n,\nminor\nand\nmajor triads\n,\ndominant\nand\ndiminished sevenths\n, formula patterns and\narpeggios\n. For example,\ntriads\nand\nsevenths\nteach how to play chords with accuracy and speed.\nScales\nteach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play\nbroken chords\nover larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of classical and romantic era compositions.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nHeinrich Schenker\nargued that musical technique's \"most striking and distinctive characteristic\" is\nrepetition\n.\n[\n86\n]\nWorks known as\n\u00e9tudes\n(meaning \"study\") are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.\nMathematics\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMusic and mathematics\nMusic theorists sometimes use mathematics to understand music, and although music has no\naxiomatic\nfoundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is \"the basis of sound\" and sound itself \"in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties\", simply because nature itself \"is amazingly mathematical\".\n[\n87\n]\nThe attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of\nset theory\n,\nabstract algebra\nand\nnumber theory\n. Some composers have incorporated the\ngolden ratio\nand\nFibonacci numbers\ninto their work.\n[\n88\n]\n[\n89\n]\nThere is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,\n[\n90\n]\nthe\nPythagoreans\n(in particular\nPhilolaus\nand\nArchytas\n)\n[\n91\n]\nof ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of\nmusical scales\nin terms of numerical\nratios\n.\nThe first 16 harmonics, their names and frequencies, showing the exponential nature of the octave and the simple fractional nature of non-octave harmonics\nIn the modern era, musical\nset theory\nuses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as\ntransposition\nand\ninversion\n, one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called\nisometries\nbecause they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an\nabelian group\nwith 12 elements. It is possible to describe\njust intonation\nin terms of a\nfree abelian group\n.\n[\n92\n]\nSerial composition and set theory\n[\nedit\n]\nTone row from\nAlban Berg\n's\nLyric Suite\n, movement I\nFurther information:\nSerialism\n,\nSet theory (music)\n,\nArnold Schoenberg\n,\nMilton Babbitt\n,\nDavid Lewin\n, and\nAllen Forte\nIn music theory, serialism is a method or technique of\ncomposition\nthat uses a series of values to manipulate different\nmusical elements\n. Serialism began primarily with\nArnold Schoenberg\n's\ntwelve-tone technique\n, though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of\npost-tonal\nthinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the\nchromatic scale\n, forming a\nrow\nor series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's\nmelody\n,\nharmony\n, structural progressions, and\nvariations\n. Other types of serialism also work with\nsets\n, collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called \"\nparameters\n\"), such as\nduration\n,\ndynamics\n, and\ntimbre\n. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the visual arts, design, and architecture\n[\n93\n]\n\"Integral serialism\" or \"total serialism\" is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch.\n[\n94\n]\nOther terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post-World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are \"general serialism\" and \"multiple serialism\".\n[\n95\n]\nMusical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by\nHoward Hanson\n(1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as\nAllen Forte\n(1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nOne branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as\ntransposition\n,\ninversion\n, and\ncomplementation\n. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nMusical semiotics\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nMusic semiology\nand\nJean-Jacques Nattiez\nSemiotician\nRoman Jakobson\nMusic semiology (\nsemiotics\n) is the study of signs as they pertain to music on a variety of levels.

The work of\nLeonard B. Meyer\nin\nStyle and Music\n[\nfull citation needed\n]\ntheorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.\nEducation and careers\n[\nedit\n]\nColumbia University\nmusic theorist\nPat Carpenter\nin an undated photo\nMusic theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right.\n[\n106\n]\nA growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians.\n[\n106\n]\nThis led to the founding of the\nSociety for Music Theory\nin the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Analyse musicale\nwas founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge d'Analyse musicale\nin Belgium and the\nGruppo analisi e teoria musicale\nin Italy the same year, the\nSociety for Music Analysis\nin the UK in 1991, the\nVereniging voor Muziektheorie\nin the Netherlands in 1999 and the\nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Musiktheorie\nin Germany in 2000.\n[\n107\n]\nThey were later followed by the Russian Society for Music Theory in 2013, the Polish Society for Music Analysis in 2015 and the\nSociedad de An\u00e1lisis y Teor\u00eda Musical\nin Spain in 2020, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers. They formed in 2018 a network of European societies for Theory and/or Analysis of Music, the\nEuroT&AM\nAs part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a\nB.Mus\nor a\nB.A.\nin music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a PhD, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory PhD programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus. and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).\nMost music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in colleges, universities or\nconservatories\n. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive: with an average of around 25 tenure-track positions advertised per year in the past decade, 80\u2013100 PhD graduates are produced each year (according to the Survey of Earned Doctorates) who compete not only with each other for those positions but with job seekers that received PhD's in previous years who are still searching for a tenure-track job. Applicants must hold a completed PhD or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired\u2014called an \"ABD\", for \"\nAll But Dissertation\n\" stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some PhD-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as\nsessional lecturers\n. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as\nMusic appreciation\nor Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a graduate school, supervising M.A. and PhD students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as\nDean\nor Chair of the School of Music.\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nList of music theorists\nMusic psychology\nMusicology\nTheory of painting\nNotes\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nSee Boethius's\nDe institutione musica\n,\n[\n2\n]\nin which he disdains \"musica instrumentalis\" as beneath the \"true\" musician who studies music in the abstract:\nMulto enim est maius atque auctius scire, quod quisque faciat, quam ipsum illud efficere, quod sciat\n(\"It is much better to know what one does than to do what one knows\").\n^\nSee, for example, chapters 4\u20137 of Christensen, Thomas (2002).\nThe Cambridge History of Western Music Theory\n.
